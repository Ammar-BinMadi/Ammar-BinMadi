# multiTemplateMatching
Config files for my GitHub profile.
files : multiTabletMatching.py, templateTissue.png, sourceTissue.jpg.

This is a python project that matches Templates by moving the Template which in our case is templateTissue.png

on the source which is sourceTissue.jpg 

and if a match is found a rectangle will be added to sourceTissue.jpg to indicate the match

The accurecy of the match can be changed but it should follows a range form 1.0 to 0.0 only.

libraries used:
numpy, openCV, matplotlib
